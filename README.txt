Version: 1.00
(c) Timo Anjala

EZ-SVG v1.00 contains 125 SVG-icons.

EZ-SVG is a free-to-use icon gallery built inside JavaScript -file. It offers an easy way to use common SVG-icons on your HTML project.
SVG-icons are created inside JavaScript -file with necessary path-, size-, and and color properties. 
Icon are then called on document with <i> -tag containing a CSS-class corresponding to specific icon.
On document, EZ-icons work as dynamic inline-elements, inheriting size- and color properties from parent element. Simple.



HOW TO SETUP ICON GALLERY
-------------------------

  1. Download latest release of EZ-SVG from GitHub.

  2. Extract "ez-svg.js" -file from ZIP-file to your project folder. Only the one file is needed.

  3. Link ez-svg.js to your HTML document, at the end of <body> -section (inside).

     <script src="location/of/ez-svg.js"></script>

  4. Now you have access to icons.



HOW TO USE ICONS
----------------

  Once you have uploaded and linked "ez-svg.js" -file on your project, you can call EZ-icons on your HTML document with <i> -tag containing CSS-class. Each icon has an unique class-name.
  Full list of icons can be found from info-page included in release ZIP-file or from project home-page (link at the bottom).

  <i class="ez-home"></i>



MANUAL ICON SIZES
-----------------

  All icons can have manual "size-class" added to them. There are 5 different sizes available: S, M, L, XL, XXL. 
  Since all icons are naturally M-size (1em), manual size-class works as multiplier to it. Manual size-class is easy to apply.
